Dedan Kimathi and Kiambu Institute Tops WorldSkills Kenya Mechatronics Competition
Team of Elsie Makara and Maxwell Magoi from Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) and Victoria Wanjiku and Disrael Ngeresa from Kiambu Institute of Technology (KIST) emerged winners of the WorldSkills Kenya pilot Mechatronics competition.

The one-week competition, which was held at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology was opened on Monday by TVET Authority Director-General Dr Kipkirui Langat who told the participants that the pilot will help WorldSkills Kenya (WSK) develop the country’s national competition frameworks in readiness for competition.

The Dedan Kimathi University of Technology team of Elsie and Maxwell scored 71.6 marks to beat their college mates Audrey Nzilani and Joanna Oluoch who scored 52.41 marks to emerge winners in the university category. While the duo of Disrael and Victoria from Kiambu Institute of Technology emerged winners in the TVET category by scoring 49.04 marks, beating Kennedy Munene and Margret Wanjiku from Masinga TVC to the second position with 41.1marks.

During the closing ceremony, the Vice-Chancellor Dedan Kimathi University of Technology Prof Ndirangu Kioni said that the institution is happy to host the event and looks forward to hosting more such competitions and also partner with TVET institutions in other areas.

“I congratulate all the teams that took part in the competition. You have worked hard to reach here. The competition was not just about winning but rather to evaluate yourself and determine what you need to do to get to the next level.” Prof. Kioni said.

He added that Kenya joining the WorldSkills Competition will give the young people an opportunity to compete with the rest at a global stage.”

The Deputy Director in the Ministry of Education Mr James Muchiri, who is also an Assistant Technical Delegate in WorldSkills Kenya thanked all those who participated in the pilot WSK Mechatronics Competition and the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology for the efforts to organize and host the competition.

This is a great opportunity that has given the students a window to showcase their competencies and skills in the area of Mechatronics. This has given our young people good exposure This now gives us confidence that our journey to compete at the WorldSkills Competition as Shanghai, China has started.

The Principal Kiambu Institute of Technology Mr Sammy Waititu also lauded all the teams, singling out his two students who emerged as the winners in the TVET category.

“It’s a big milestone for us to have been invited to participate. I congratulate the winners and all the students who participated. My students Victoria and Disrael you have done us proud. Masinga TVC who came second, I also congratulate you because you have been worthy competitors.”

Principal Masinga TVC Mr Kennedy Njoroge, who is one of the judges in the competition said the inaugural competition has been beneficial to both the students and trainers.

One of the winners Victoria Wanjiku from KIST said that the competition has been a revelation to her and the other students who participated.

“We were able to emerge winners largely because of the dual training currently implemented at our institution where we spend half of the time at the institution and the other half in the industry. Learning in the industry has given us hands-on skills and that is why we were able to easily interact with these machines.

Eleven TVET institutions participated in the competition and two universities. However, Dedan Kimathi presented seven teams of two students each while Moi universities attended the competition to learn and participate in future events.
